ownCloud app implementing passwordless data access from trusted servers
-------

The purpose of this app is to allow servers trusted by an ownCloud user to access
his or her files with no credentials. Trust can be placed on IP addresses and it is
up to the system administrator to ensure that this is actually a trustworthy mechanism.

The app also uses jqueryFileTree from
http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/03/jquery-file-tree/
to implement a tree-view file/directory selector.
