#### ownCloud app implementing passwordless data access from trusted servers

The purpose of this app is to allow servers trusted by an ownCloud user to access
his or her files with no credentials. Trust can be placed on IP addresses,
certificates and more - and it is up to the system administrator to ensure that
these are actually a trustworthy mechanisms.

The app also uses jqueryFileTree from
http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/03/jquery-file-tree/
to implement a tree-view file/directory selector.
